# AndroidApp
# Overview

This was my first time trying to create an android app and I discovered it was much harder than expected. Even after spending a long time looking into resources I still wasn't able to implement all the features I wanted too and ended up creating a very simple app that just says Hello, my name is Kylie. This will definitely be a project I come back too
